* Statistical Modeling of Reservoir Operations
** Simulating California reservoir operation using the classification and regression-tree algorithm combined with a shuffled cross-validation scheme (Yang et al., 2016)
*** Abstract
**** 9 major reservoirs in California
**** Original CART, enhanced CART, random forest,
***** Enhanced and random forest outperform orignal CART
***** Enhanced CART predicts peak flow better than random forest
**** Oroville lake is significantly dominated by SWP allocation amount
**** Reservoirs with low elevation are more significant to inflow than others.
*** Introduction
**** TODO Comeback and read introduction for other related literature
*** Reservoirs and Data
**** Trinity Lake, Don Pedro Reservoir, New Exchequer Reservoir, Folsom Lake, Friant Reservoir, New Melones Reservoir, Oroville, Success Lake, Shasta Lake
***** All reservoirs belong to different river basins, therefore no cascade effects are studied
**** California Data Exchange Center (CDEC)
***** Gathers information from various organizations
**** Model Input:
***** Reservoir Storage
****** During verification, this is calculated using mass balance and simulated releases of previous day
***** Daily inflow
***** Daily accumulated precipitation [we dont use]
***** Snow depth in upstream mountains [we dont use]
***** Downstream flow conditions [we dont use]
***** Water Year Index (wet/dry conditions) [we dont use]
****** (1) wet, (2) above normal, (3) below normal, (4) dry, (5) critical year
***** Six river indices: [we dont use]
****** Sacramento Valley Oct-Mar runoff
****** Sacramento Valley Apr-Jul runoff
****** Sacramento Valley water year total runoff
****** Same things above but for San Joaquin Valley
***** State Water Project (SWP) allocation amount [we dont use]
***** Month of the year to control for seasonality
**** Model Output:
***** Controlled reservoir daily outflow [release]
*** Methodology
**** Classification and Regression Tree (CART) algorithm
**** They fit a model for each reservoir
***** This is in contrast to our goal of fitting a model that works for many reservoirs
*** Results
**** Their simulation results with the best model all have good NSE ( >= 0.75 )
**** Downstream (low elevation reservoirs) are more dependent on inflow
***** We see similar results in across the country with out methods (except for Lower Colorado)
**** Authors find that releases are dependent on downstream river stage as well
***** They state that downstream status is crucial for release decisions during high flow periods
****** Basically, if downstream flow exceeds a certain level, operators must reduce their release and deviate from rule curves
**** They state that at the daily level, the release time series is highly variable.
***** This variability means that regression models underestimate the role of storage in release prediction as it is less variable on a day-to-day basis
***** Additionally, rule curves are more of a guideline than strict rules and releases often deviate from USACE specified curves
