# Notes from August 25th, 2021 to September 1st, 2021

Last Modified: {{currentdate}}

## Notes from Sankar Meeting

- Proposal defense document (powerpoint)
  - coregs, predict release, nwm, res opt
  - 10 days ahead give draft
    - ETD document

- If we are in 1 bin, what is the probability of being in another bin in the next time step
  - Break it down into sub-bins for important leafs
  - Look at last 0.05 percentiles in each group, what is probability of jumping to the next

## My Questions

- EDT document
  - Chapter 1
    - COREGS
  - Chapter 2
    - Predict Release
  - Chapter 3
    - Generalized Release Curves for CONUS
  - Chapter 4
    - Reservoir Optimization Algorithms
  - General Question
    - Am I condensing the journal articles into these chapters?
      - e.g., Take the coregs document and condense/synthesize it into a tangible story line for chapter 1

- Bin probabilities
  - I looked at this several different ways
    - First is simply the probability of being in a different leaf tomorrow given I am in a current leaf today
      - e.g., $P(L5_{{t+1}} | L4_{{t}})$
      - Takeaway from this is pretty much what we would expect:
        - You are most likely to be in the same bin tomorrow than any single bin
        - Only Leaf 4 has a less than 50 % chance of being a leaf 4 again tomorrow
        - If you do change leafs, you are most likely going to move to an adjacent leaf rather than a large jump
    - Second I looked at the probability of transitioning if you are in the upper and lower 1/3s of the leaf
      - Again, takeaways here are expected:
        - Reasonable chance of moving up or down a leaf if you are in the upper or lower 1/3, respectively
        - No 1/3 has a more than 25% chance of transitioning up or down
      - One interesting observation is that the probabilty of moving to the next leaf follows a pretty nice pattern with
        it peaking near the middle leafs and being the lowest on the end (for both the upper and lower 1/3)
        - The t prob of moving to a lower leaf does not follow a nice pattern
    - Third, I looked at the combination of the two plots above
      - The t prob of each third within a leaf to every other leaf.
      - This plot is a bit harder to dig into than the other two, but it shows a lot of information
        - EXPLANTION:
          - rows are the next leaf and columns are the start leaf
          - So when the label is "Next Leaf = 3 | Start Leaf = 2", the plot shows the probability of each third within leaf 2 of transitioning to leaf 3
        - Immediately noticed is the patterns along each row.
  - X metrics for each transition

  | Transition | $S_{{t-1}} - \bar{{S}}_7$ | $S_{{t-1}} \times I_{{t}}$ | $R_{{t-1}}$    | $\bar{{R}}_7$  | $I_t$          | $\bar{{I}}_7$  | $S_{{t-1}}$    |
  | ---------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
  | Down       | -0.030 ± 0.078            | -0.026 ± 1.008             | 0.456 ± 0.860  | 0.256 ± 0.919  | -0.011 ± 1.043 | -0.039 ± 0.863 | -0.042 ± 1.013 |
  | Same       | 0.005 ± 0.089             | -0.031 ± 0.909             | -0.060 ± 1.069 | -0.080 ± 1.070 | -0.034 ± 0.912 | -0.009 ± 1.011 | 0.000 ± 0.992  |
  | Up         | 0.017 ± 0.106             | 0.122 ± 1.223              | -0.283 ± 0.721 | -0.013 ± 0.791 | 0.114 ± 1.188  | 0.066 ± 1.080  | 0.043 ± 1.009  |

  - Overall, there are not distinct relationships. When storage is high (either absolutely or relatively) it becomes more likely that we transition to a higher leaf (higher release bracket). This is logical
  - There is an interesting relationship between transition and Release
    - When we transition to a lower node, yesterdays release is higher on average.
    - The same can be said for rolling release.
