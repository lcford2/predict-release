## This weeks TODO:

- Fit sin curve to monthly intercepts: 
  $m = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \times sin(\omega t)$
  - Each of the parameters above are fit for each reservoir

![Wave Intercept Plots](G:\My Drive\PHD\SRY_curves\data\notes\md\sin_wave_intercepts_bg.png)

- Create a road map for synthesizing what we have done:
  - 2 part series paper:
    - 1 - Synthesis
    - 2 - Prediction
  - Title:  A Data-driven approach to quantify TVA's Reservoir Operation: Part I â€“ Synthesis Part II: Validation
- Pull together some slides that show this projects process and get to Sankar
  - Sent to sankar Friday morning at 8:24
- Meet Sankar on Friday at 10 am 
  - Decided to move meeting to Monday at 9 am so he can go over the slides over the weekend
  - Moved meeting to 10:30 am on Tuesday

## Sankar Comments on Slide Deck
- Watts Bar should be upstream reservoir because its residence time is so high
  - This was actually just slip up on my part. Watts Bar and Watauga were just swapped
    - So were Wilbur and Wilson actually
- Calculate correlation between observed and predicted release values. This will let us know if we biased or if we are not capturing patterns.
  - Intercepts are there to capture temporal variability in reservoir operations that can not be captured by a simple day ahead parameterization. 
  - Examining the plots on slide 20, we can see there are several reservoir that exhibit no monthly bias (as they have near zero intercepts throughout the year)
  - In this context (where we fit a model for each reservoir), no reservoir will have bias over the entire modeled period (BLUE)
    - This indicates that poor performance must be dictated by poor correlation. 
  - I will check this to be thorough and we can discuss it. 
- Estimate sin wave parameters as a function of residence time.
  - I regressed all wave parameters against RT, MStL, and MRel with an intercept (separately). None of the independent variables had any predictive power for any parameter. 
  - To assess all their possible relationships at the same time, I checked the cross-correlation of all of those variables
  - None have a significant correlation with the wave parameters (>0.4)
  - The wave offset and amplitude modifier are highly negatively correlated
  - As are the offset and the frequency modifier $\omega$
  - $\omega$ and the amplitude term are positively correlated
  - Score is positively correlated with offset, and negative with other two terms
    - As the changes in operation increase in frequency, the sin wave becomes worse 
    - Same can be said for larger swings in amplitude
      - i.e. if the changes in operation are larger the sine wave is worse. 
    - Both of these effects are not that strong though and there are definitely samples that do not fit this trend
      - Ocoee3 for example

- Interpret each tree on page 12
  - I also need to rerun this model and get an updated tree and parameters.  
  - I reran, and provided interpretation in the slides
