## Notes from Sankar Meeting

Last Modified: {{currentdate}}

### This weeks TODO:
- For the 6 bad plots in the `thirds_1to1` plot:
  - Lower third, train and test, upstream and downstream. Middle third, train and test, upstream
  - Check if the poor performance is due to bias or variance
  - $\text{MSE} = \text{Bias}^2 + \text{Var}_{\text{modeled}} + \sigma^2$
    - [Bias Variance Tradeoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias%E2%80%93variance_tradeoff)
  - Can look at correlation between modeled and actual values and bias as an alternative to the above
  - This should be done at the reservoir level, not the aggregate level
    - (i.e.) with in each third, look at bias/variance/correlation for all the samples for each reservoir in that third
- Spatially-varying parameters
  - Rather than grouping reservoirs when fitting models, we can use each reservoir as its own group
  - Given the current setup this will basically be fitting a model for each reservoir. 
  - We can either:
    - vary intercepts for each reservoir
      - This should help with bias
    - vary slopes for each reservoir and each covariate
      - This should help with variance
    - Vary both
      - Improving bias and variance.
  - Results
    - Thirds score correlated with RT

        |Bin | Pearson's *r* |
        |----|---------------|
        | 0  |     -0.423    |
        | 1  |     -0.764    |
        | 2  |     -0.750    |


- Seasonal bias for each reservoir. 
  - Take the monthly bias plots and break them out in to each reservoir
  - Maybe reservoirs on the y axis, months on the x axis, and color bias 
  - (i.e.) a heat map 
- I also need to write down the model formulation mathematically and algorithmically
- Reach out to committee members to set up a date for my preliminary exam during the first week of October
  - October 4th - 8th
