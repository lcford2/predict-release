# Notes from September 19th, 2022 to September 23st, 2022

Last Modified: {{currentdate}}

## This weeks work

- No real trends in the model error vs variable plots
  - I looked at the standardized error, unstandardized error, as well as absolute and actual error
  - Same for standardized and unstandardized variables
- Seasonal and interannual variability
  - Annual group percentages show interannual variability and can help relate how our model adapts to specific hydroclimatic events
  - Monthly group percentages in side-by-side bar with CI bars shows the average intra-annual variability along with an estimate of the interannual variability for each group.
- Still need to look at inflection/transistion points.
