  * Might have to do this one based on storage change. We have elevation and storage curves as well as upstream inflow. So theoretically we could back calculate release. Further, if we calculate this we can add all of the above Downstream (-) gages and get the inflow into 

## Big Bend

* Upstream  
  * 06441500
  * 06442130
  * 06442600
  * 06452000
  * 06442900
  * 06452320
  * plus release from oahe
* Downstream
  * Probably will have to calculate release as well

## Fort Randall

* Upstream
  * 06453600
  * 06465500
  * 06466500
  * plus release from big bend
* Downstream
  * will have to calculate release as well
